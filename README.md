# Typewriter-v1

## Explanation

This project was made with HTML and Javascript. As it's just an initial draft, I didn't put CSS in it, but if anyone wants to fork it, feel free to customize it however you want.
The project consists of two files, an html file and a javascript file.
How it works?
Basically, just click on the button on the HTML page and the javascript typewriter function will be called via onclick. In this case, the text will be written letter by letter at a standard speed. That's all, folks.
